            Brazil (Portuguese: Brasil; Brazilian Portuguese: [bɾaˈziw]),[nt 1] officially the Federative Republic of
            Brazil (Portuguese: About this
            soundRepública Federativa do Brasil),[11] is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. At
            8.5 million square kilometers
            (3.2 million square miles)[12] and with over 211 million people, Brazil is the world's fifth-largest country
            by area and the sixth most
            populous. Its capital is Brasília, and its most populous city is São Paulo. The federation is composed of
            the union of the 26 states and
            the Federal District. It is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one
            in the Americas;[13][14] it is
            also one of the most multicultural and ethnically diverse nations, due to over a century of mass immigration
            from around the world;[15] as
            well as the most populous Roman Catholic-majority country.
            Brazil was inhabited by numerous tribal nations prior to the landing in 1500 of explorer Pedro Álvares
            Cabral, who claimed the area for
            the Portuguese Empire. Brazil remained a Portuguese colony until 1808 when the capital of the empire was
            transferred from Lisbon to Rio de
            Janeiro. In 1815, the colony was elevated to the rank of kingdom upon the formation of the United Kingdom of
            Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves.
            Independence was achieved in 1822 with the creation of the Empire of Brazil, a unitary state governed under
            a constitutional monarchy and a
            parliamentary system. The ratification of the first constitution in 1824 led to the formation of a bicameral
            legislature, now called the National
            Congress. The country became a presidential republic in 1889 following a military coup d'état. An
            authoritarian military junta came to power in
            1964 and ruled until 1985, after which civilian governance resumed. Brazil's current constitution,
            formulated in 1988, defines it as a democratic
            federal republic.[18] Due to its rich culture and history, the country ranks thirteenth in the world by
            number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.[19]
